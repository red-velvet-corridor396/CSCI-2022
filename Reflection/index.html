<h3>24 Hours Without Phone - Reflection</h3>
<p>Shelving my phone for a full day was a mixed bag. Most of the things I do are on the internet, be it talking to friends, planning hangouts, enjoying hobbies, or doing assignments. So putting the phone down was putting my life on hold for a day. I kind of dreaded it, since I was afraid of missing out on anything with my friends, and I also expected it to be very boring. So I prepared a fair amount in advance. I tried to think of things to fill the hour void and also tried to get things like homework out of the way. I also let my friends/family know that I would be unavailable for a day. For some of them I felt bad, since I had been too busy to talk to them recently and had to yet again postpone hanging out with them. I put my phone down on Saturday night, and I spent my last waking hours cleaning my room and folding laundry, something I’ve been procrastinating a lot in school. The day was over, so I didn’t feel the urge to check my phone yet. It was a relaxing evening. I just tidied up my room in silence, and I found myself with a clearer mind and feeling more “ready” to go to bed when the time came. The next day was pretty weird. Firstly, I had the urge to check my phone as soon as I woke up. It’s the first thing I do every morning, so I was practically reaching for it before my eyes were even open. I had urges to pick it up often, usually when I finished whatever I had found to distract myself with, and I needed something else to fill the void. It’s always my first choice–and an automatic one. At times, I felt really anxious about missing out on things with my friends, and that made it difficult to be present 100% of the time. When I was able to, though, I felt calmer (albeit extremely bored). I felt weird leaving my phone when I went out, too. It felt like I was leaving home unprepared, and if something happened I would be kind of helpless. But it ended up being alright; nothing happened. I took more time doing things like eating or walking from place to place, as I didn’t have anything else planned. It felt lonely though. I wasn’t able to make plans with anyone in advance, and I didn’t have access to any of my friends. The whole day was a weird mix of feeling calm, bored, and isolated. Eventually I ended up spending a few hours in my room sewing–something I had been meaning to do. And I noticed that without anything to scroll, my free time went a little bit slower, and I was forced to actually think of stuff to do rather than just flush all my free time down the drain.</p>
