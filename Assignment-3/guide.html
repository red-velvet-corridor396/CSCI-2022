            <p class="guidetext bold">In the interactive version of this artwork, you can select a triangle and customize the RGB values. Below is a list of step-by-step instructions for how to do this.</p>
            <ol class="guidetext">
                <li>Press a number key 1 through 8 to select the triangle you'd like to customize. The box at the bottom right of the screen should update to reflect what triangle you've selected. The map (left) shows what triangle each number corresponds to. An easy way to remember it is to imagine a vertical line going down and think about which triangles the line would go through first. When the line reaches the bottom of the frame, start another line that goes through the next set of triangles, and so on.</li>
                <li>Now press either "r", "g"," or "b" on the keyboard to choose which color value you'd like to edit. The complete RGB values of the selected triangle should appear below the triangle selection, and the RGB indicator should change color.</li>
                <li>Click on one of the four numbers below the RGB indicator to choose by what increment you'd like to increase the RGB values. You can choose 1, 5, 10, or 50.</li>
                <li>Now you're ready to change the RGB values. Use the up arrow key to increase the color values and the down arrow key to decrease them.</li>
                <li>Have fun!</li>
