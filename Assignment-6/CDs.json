It's what got me hooked on it in the first place. A lot of the time, the bass isn't so audible in rock and metal. I think hearing it so clearly here really enhances the music.",

When I first heard 'To Mega Therion,' I wasn't really into it, but I could never stay away from an album with such a cool cover. 'Dawn of Meggido' was probably the song that kept me coming back (whereas the others took quite a while to grow on me). I liked 'Dawn of Meggido' for its booming drums and gloomy atmosphere, but over time I've come to really appreciate the ferocity of this album and the power in Tom G. Warrior's vocals. These days I would say my favorite track is either 'The Usurper' or 'Jewel Throne.' This is 100% one of my favorite albums.",

There were a couple tracks I liked, although overall I wasn't blown away or anything.
