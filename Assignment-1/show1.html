            <p>So this was my very first metal show. I bought tickets many months prior, and when the time came I took a plan from Seattle to Spokane and checked into a hotel. It was a pretty cool hotel actually, very dark/gothic looking; I don't remember the name, sadly. Anyways, I checked into my hotel and got ready for the show. I ended up Doordashing food right before, but I ended up cutting it pretty close. I must've taken a long time to get ready beforehand or something. I don't really remember as it was like a year and 8 months ago now. The first band to play was Blood Incantation. I didn't really like their performance back then. It pains me to say that because I'd kill to see them now. I think they were probably playing stuff from Interdimensional Extinction (at the very least, I remember seeing its artwork somewhere) and maybe Starspawn, which would make sense since I still haven't really gotten into those releases. Absolute Elsewhere is pretty good, but it's Hidden History of the Human Race that I'm really into. Next up was Gorguts. I think they were pretty good; I liked at least a couple songs enough to get them on video at least. Mayhem was also pretty cool. I really enjoyed all of the tracks from Deathcrush. I always preferred Deathcrush over De mysteriis Dom Sathanas by a fair amount. For a lot of the De mysteriis Dom Sathanas tracks they played, I couldn't actually tell which ones were which, and I was kinda just waiting for Freezing Moon. A lot of the riffs sounded similar, so I was going "oh, this must be Freezing Moon" for several of the songs. Once they actually played it though, I knew, based on the crowd's reaction. They played some post-reunion stuff too, with the operatic vocals and stuff. It was kinda neat, but I never really checked out their later stuff so I guess it didn't really make much of an impression. It was cool seeing Necrobutcher throwing up the horns at fans as he walked off stage.</p>
            <p>Between Mayhem and Cannibal Corpse's sets I walked out into the lobby and ran into none other than Luc Lemay at the Gorguts merch booth. They were sold out of a lot of stuff, if I recall. I asked for something (maybe a CD or a patch, I don't remember) and he said they ran out. Cannibal Corpse didn't have any patches either. Anyways, he was talking with fans and taking photos and stuff when I first walked into the lobby, so I ended up getting a photo with him. I remember him telling me to give some horns and so I did, but this was my first metal show so I had no idea if I was doing it right. I wasn't sure which way my hand should be facing or what, and he said "more horns!" and I remember just stretching my index finger and pinkie out farther. In retrospect he probably meant for me to use my other hand. Oh well. I'm clueless like that sometimes. It ended up being kind of an awkward photo. Luc also blinked. I used to kind of dislike that photo, but I think it's pretty cool now, since it's Luc Lemay. At the time, I had no idea at the time that Gorguts was kind of a big deal--same for Blood Incantation; I would be a lot more excited to meet Luc Lemay for a second time.

              <p>My interaction with other concertgoers was limited and mostly positive, although a couple guys were kinda weird. One guy seemed to...take a liking to me I guess. I was wearing my Bathory t-shirt and he sorta just hovered around me. He was sorta touching my shirt and nudging me, and he said he was my biggest fan and asked if anyone picked on me (I said no). Then he said he "isn't a white knight or anything" but if anyone picked on me he'd "fuckin kill em." He wasn't giving me much personal space and his breath reeked of alcohol, so that kinda sucked. He also showed me a picture of his newborn and I had to pretend like I cared. To this day I still wondered if he thought I was a girl or something. I was fairly young and I'm pretty short/skinny (plus the long hair) so I guess it isn't impossible that a drunk person would confuse me for a girl. Or maybe he's just gay, lol. If I was a girl though, he would've been touching my tits when he was patting my shirt. </p>
              <p>Cannibal Corpse's set was great, although I was really tired near the end and kind of waiting for it to be over. I still had fun, don't get me wrong, but it's not uncommon for me to get tired near the end and want the show to wrap up soon. If I had the energy though, I'd be asking for more songs. I had a fun time witnessing Corpsegrinder's stage presence firsthand. I remember him wiping his forehead with a towel and then saying "This towel sucks!" and throwing it in the air and punching it into the crowd. Good stuff. In terms of merch, I bought a Mayhem flag and a longsleeve/t-shirt with their tour artwork (a pig's head on a stake; still one of the better pieces of tour artwork I've seen, honestly), a Cannibal Corpse tour shirt, a tiyedye Cannibal Corpse shirt, a Deathcrush patch, and signed records from both Mayhem and Cannibal Corpse. The Mayhem record I bought had everyone's signature except Necrobutcher's though, which I was frustrated about. I almost bought another one from a scalper on eBay that *did* have Necrobutcher's signature on it, but I talked myself out of it thankfully. I learned fairly quickly that signed stuff isn't nearly as cool if it wasn't signed personally. I don't think I bought any more signed merch after this show. </p>
              <p>When the show was over, we were all standing in line to either get out or go to the merch booth or whatever, and some fat dude pipes up like "GET OUT OF MY ASS, THIS ISN'T A PRISON!!!" and this just starts shoving people out of the way (including me) and storms out of the venue. People are a lot nicer at the venues I go to in Seattle/Portland. Overall, it was a mixed bag in some ways, but a solid for a first metal show and just in general. Unfortunately, I slept through my alarm that night and missed my flight back home, and so I woke up to my aunt (who lives in the area) banging on my hotel door. Not a great way to the start the next day. I also missed my calculus class that morning</p>
